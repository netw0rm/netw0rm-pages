Welcome to Carte Noire.

Carte Noire began as a new theme for [my personal blog][1], but has now taken
on a life of its own as a free theme for Jekyll.

The 对资源的逻辑抽象theme has been designed with simplicity and readability in mind. It makes
use of third party services such as Disqus ad AddThis to ensure the blog has
all the features you would expect from a dynamic application such as Wordpress
but with the hosting and maintenance simplicity of Jekyll.

Please use/copy/share Carte Noire!

我个人的理解虚拟化既是对资源的逻辑抽象、隔离、再分配、管理的一个过程。所有虚拟化厂商所宣传的各种功能特色，都可以归结为逻辑抽象、隔离、再分配、管理这四个过程中，刚接触虚拟化的朋友只要记住一点，虚拟化技术确实有很多优势，我们需要做的就是取其所长补己之短
